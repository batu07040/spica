      We only offer support for our Managed Spica customers, customers paying for hourly support.
      However, you can ask for help on our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/spica-engine/shared_invite/enQtNzYzMDE3NjQ2MTkyLTA3MTg4ZTViZGI0MThiYzdhNTYxMTQxNjcwYzRjZTJhZDE4YWFhOGU5NmUzMGZiYjlmOWY2NDg5OTUxZjM2NDM" target="_blank">Slack</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/HJTrRMH" target="_blank">Discord</a> community if you are
      using open source licenses!
    </p>
    <p>
      For issues with Spica itself, chances are submitting a Bug Report is the best course or
      action. If you believe you have found an issue with the Spica, API, SDK, or Documentation â€”
      please head over to <a href="https://github.com/spica-engine/spica" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to fill out a Bug Report on the appropriate
      repository.
